# Advanced-Configuration-Management-with-Kustomize-and-AWS
This project explores practical experience in integrating Kustomize with AWS resources, managing secrets, and optimising Kubernetes configurations for production environments.

This project aims to deepen the understanding of using Kustomize in Kubernetes, focusing on CI/CD integration, handling complex configurations, and best practices.

For this advanced project on Configuration Management with Kustomize, focusing on CI/CD integration, complex configurations, and best practices, the following technical prerequisites are essential. Each item includes a description and links for installation and documentation.

### Why is this project relevant?
Think of this advanced Kustomize project as learning to conduct a symphony orchestra. In the beginning stages, you learn how to play individual instruments (basic Kubernetes objects and Kustomize configurations). As you progress, you're now learning how to conduct the entire orchestra (managing complex configurations and automating deployments with CI/CD pipelines). Just like how a conductor ensures each section of the orchestra works in harmony to create a beautiful symphony, you'll learn to orchestrate various components of Kubernetes to work seamlessly together. Integrating Kustomize into CI/CD pipelines is like conducting the orchestra through a complex musical piece, ensuring each note (configuration change) is played at the right time and in harmony with the others. This advanced course helps you transform from a musician into a conductor, mastering the art of Kubernetes configuration management in sophisticated and automated environments.

## Lesson 4.1: Integrating Kustomize into CI/CD Pipelines
**Objective**: Gain hands-on experience in automating Kubernetes configuration management using Kustomize integrated into GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow.
### 1. Setting Up GitHub Actions:
- Ensure you have a GitHub repository for your Kubernetes project with Kustomize configurations.
- Example repository structure:
.github/workflows/
base/
overlays/

### 2. Configuring the CI/CD Pipeline:
1. Workflow Definition:
- Start by defining the name of the workflow and the trigger event (e.g., push to the main branch)
- Example:
```yaml
name: Deploy with Kustomize
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main

```
2. Defining Jobs:
- Define a job named deploy that runs on an Ubuntu latest environment.
Example:
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

```
3. Checking Out Code:
- Use the `actions/checkout@v2` action to check out your code to the GitHub Actions runner.
- Example:
```yaml
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
```
4. Setting Up Kubectl and Kustomize</strong>:
- Set up `kubectl` and `kustomize` using respective GitHub Actions.
Example:
```yaml
- name: Set up Kubectl
  uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v1
- name: Set up Kustomize
  uses: imranismail/setup-kustomize@v1
```
5. Applying Kustomize Configuration:
- Apply the Kustomize configuration to your Kubernetes cluster.
- Ensure your GitHub Actions runner is configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster.
- Example:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Kubernetes
  run: |
    kustomize build ./overlays/production/ | kubectl apply -f -
```

Now your YAML file should look something like this:

```yaml
# Example for GitHub Actions
name: Deploy with Kustomize
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Kubectl
      uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v1
    - name: Set up Kustomize
      uses: imranismail/setup-kustomize@v1
    - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      run: |
        kustomize build ./overlays/production/ | kubectl apply -f -

```
- **Note**: Ensure your CI/CD platform has access to your Kubernetes cluster.

### 3. Testing the CI/CD Pipeline:
1. Make Configuration Changes:
- Modify a Kustomize configuration in your repository, such as changing the replica count in an overlay.

2. Commit and Push Changes:
- Commit your changes to the repository and push them to the main branch.
- Example commands:
`git add .`
`git commit -m "Update Kustomize configuration"`
`git push origin main`
